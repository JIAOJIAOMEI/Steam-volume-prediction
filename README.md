# summary
The dataset for this project originates from a competition, comprising 2888 training samples and 1925 testing samples. It encompasses 37 features along with a target variable. My objective is to utilize various regression algorithms from the sklearn library to train different regression models. The models will predict outcomes for the test data, which will then be submitted to the competition website for evaluation. My best performance ranks above 200 out of over 10,000 participants.
# some experience
A few years ago, when I participated in this competition, I experimented with various data preprocessing techniques such as dimensionality reduction(PCA), normalization, and correlation analysis. I also explored different regression algorithms and compared their predictive results. **However, it wasn't until I began working with machine learning algorithms in a professional setting that I realized the true importance of the dataset. In industrial applications, data collection is often costly. If you have a good understanding of the specific problem you're tackling, know which parameters might be crucial, and understand how to appropriately select the range for each feature, then many machine learning models can yield satisfactory results. Ultimately, the quality of the dataset plays a pivotal role.**
