The dataset for this project originates from a competition, comprising 2888 training samples and 1925 testing samples. It encompasses 37 features along with a target variable. My objective is to utilize various regression algorithms from the sklearn library to train different regression models. The models will predict outcomes for the test data, which will then be submitted to the competition website for evaluation. My best performance ranks above 200 out of over 10,000 participants.
